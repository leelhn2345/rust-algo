# number to words

create a function that takes in an integer value where 1<=value<=999,999,999,
and returns it spelled out in English as a string.

Example:

|number|words|
-------|-----|  
|5|"Five only"|
|73|"seventy three only"|
|413|"Four hundred and thirteen only"|
|2345|"Two thousand, three hundred and forty five only"|
|987,434|"Nine hundred and eighty seven thousand, four hundred and thirty four only"|
|534,435,119|"Five hundred and thirty four million, four hundred and thirty five thousand, one hundred and nineteen only"|

## solution

the solution is not perfect - only leaves some string formating.
